# Mail

This project was part of my CS50 Web Programming course. 

## Functionality

This is a website that emulates functionality of a website of an email provider, where users upon registration and signing in can successfully send letters
to other users stored in the system. They can also reply and archive emails.


#### This Project was written in VSCode using Django framework.

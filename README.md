# Mail

This project was part of my CS50 Web Programming course. 

## Functionality

This is a website that emulates functionality of a website of an email provider, where users upon registration and signing in can successfully send letters
to other users stored in the system. They can also reply and archive emails.


#### This Project was written in VSCode using Django framework.


### Files

For this project, we were already given all the functions for [views.py](mail/views.py) that controls the view pages of the website. Our task was to modify [index.html](mail/templates/mail/index.html) and [inbox.js](mail/static/mail/inbox.js), a javascript file that is responsible for most of the website's functionality (sending/replying to emails, archiving conversations).
